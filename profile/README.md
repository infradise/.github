# Welcome to the Infradise organization

Infradise Inc. is a company that creates open source cloud infrastructure software, such as Kubernetes and OpenStack, leveraging Linux containers and virtualization technologies. 

# What's the meaning of Infradise

The word 'Infradise,' which is a combination of the words 'infrastructure' and 'paradise' in the company name, represents a desire to create a paradise in which people can live happily ever after without worrying about open source cloud infrastructure. 
The company's purpose is to develop software that enables this type of development environment.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to ensure remotely controllable and portable software benefits all of Developer and DevOps.

# Rationale

Over the decades the open source cloud infrastructure (such as Kubernetes and OpenStack, leveraging Linux containers and virtualization technologies), is being evolved. For instance, number of computing cores on major cloud service has been increased by a factor of 5 from 10 million cores in the last 5 years. As one of the largest deployments in the world, it continues to grow across deployments of all sizes across industries and geographies.

However, management tools for these services and deployments are being relatively underdeveloped and still have a long way to go. Infradise would like to join in solving this problem. To this end, we would like to suggest mission-critical solutions, starting with our products publishing (such as Visualkube and OnePass VPN). Furthermore, we also research virtual private network tunneling technology to ensure security-enhanced and fast private network as secondary management tool.

Infradise is a company for Kubernetes and OpenStack, Virtual Private Network (VPN). Interestingly the word 'Infradise,' which is a combination of the words 'infrastructure' and 'paradise' in the company name, represents a desire to create a paradise in which people can manage them happily ever after without the problem as mentioned above.
