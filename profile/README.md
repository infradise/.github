# Tagline

Simplified Management & Seamless Collaboration for K8s & OpenStack.

# Our Mission

Our mission is to ensure remotely controllable and portable software benefits all Developers and DevOps engineers.

# Rationale

Over the past decade, open-source cloud infrastructure, particularly Kubernetes and OpenStack leveraging container and virtualization technologies, has evolved dramatically. The scale is immense; computing power on major cloud platforms, for instance, has grown exponentially, multiplying severalfold in recent years. This rapid expansion across industries and geographies, while powerful, results in increasingly complex systems that demand sophisticated management.

However, the development of robust management and collaboration tools for these complex environments has lagged significantly. This is the challenge Infradise was founded to address. We develop mission-critical solutions designed to simplify and secure cloud infrastructure operations, starting with our core product, Visualkube – an integrated management and collaboration platform for Kubernetes and OpenStack. Complementing this, we leverage our expertise in virtual private network technology through OnePass VPN, ensuring secure, high-performance access essential for effective remote management and collaboration.

Infradise is a startup developing specialized solutions for managing and securing cloud-native infrastructure like Kubernetes and OpenStack, including advanced Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology. Our name, 'Infradise,'merges 'infrastructure' and 'paradise,' reflecting our core mission: to transform complex infrastructure management into a seamless and efficient experience, resolving the challenges outlined above.
